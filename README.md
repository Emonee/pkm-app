# PKM App

This is my first app and the goal is to build a pokemon team that start by chosen your favorite pkm, then a chain of recomendations are triggered based on weaknesses and resistances.

Here I explore (and learn more than anything else) the limits of the fetch() API, how to chain them and make a logic out of that.

Another goal is to style the app using exclusively Bootstrap.

Wish me luck and...

Catch them all!! ðŸ’œ
